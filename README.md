# 🏪 ShopMap Editor — Kauflauf Hackathon MVP

### Hi, I'm Valentino 👋  
I really love automating stuff, so for this hackathon I decided to build a small MVP as a subpart of a bigger vision.  

The **big idea** behind the project is to make it **easy to create digital store layouts** — where customers can see where items are located, so that **automated paths** can be generated.  
Later, this could even be integrated with **robotics for automated shopping**, and also help employees quickly locate specific products inside the store.

## 💡 Concept

For the hackathon, I focused on **one key part** of the larger concept:  
### 🗺️ The ShopMap Editor

With it, you can design and manage shop layouts visually, directly in your browser.

Together with my girlfriend, we also created **custom pixel art sprites** to give it a fun and unique visual style ❤️

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **Enter the App**  
   You start on the global entry page and can navigate to “Start”.

2. **Demo Shop**  
   There’s already a demo shop available.  
   *(Since this is an MVP, only one shop currently exists in the backend — creating a new one won’t persist yet.)*

3. **Edit Shop Info**  
   You can edit the shop’s name and description directly.

4. **Shop Overview**  
   Inside, you’ll see the full shop map with its sections.  
   - Example: The **Meat Section** just got smaller, so let’s resize it.  
   - Add a **new section** like the freezer area.

5. **Section Editing**  
   You can open any section and manage its items:
   - Add new items (e.g., 🥝 *Kiwis* in the fruit section)  
   - Remove items (e.g., 🍌 *Bananas* — not everyone likes them 😄)  
   - Exit by clicking the blue background.

6. **Persistence**  
   When you leave and come back, all changes remain saved thanks to Supabase backend persistence.
